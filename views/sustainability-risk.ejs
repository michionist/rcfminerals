                        <p>
                            RCF recognises that all aspects of our business involve significant risk, including both
                            threats (downside risk) and opportunities (upside risk). We are committed to managing all
                            sources of risk in a proactive and effective manner through competent risk management. This
                            requires high quality risk analysis to allow appropriate management decision to be taken at
                            all levels in the company. A number of systems are in place to identify and manage risk,
                            these include:
                            The identification and regular review of all significant business risk facing the company.
                            The provision of information by management to the board, on a periodic basis, as to the
                            status of any plans, controls, policies and/or procedures to manage the significant business
                            risks.
                            Guidelines for ensuring that capital expenditures and revenue commitments exceeding certain
                            approved limits are placed before the board for approval.
                            Limits and controls for all financial exposures, including the uses of derivatives
                        </p>
